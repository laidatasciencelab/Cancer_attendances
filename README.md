## About the project 
**Background**

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the widespread disruption of cancer health provision services across the entirety of the cancer care pathway in the UK, from screening to treatment. The potential long-term health implications, including increased mortality for those who missed diagnoses or appointments, are concerning. However, the precise impact of lockdown policies on national cancer health service provision across diagnostic groups is understudied. This research seeks to systematically evaluate changes in patterns of attendance for groups of individuals diagnosed with cancer, stratified by both time-based exposures and by patient-based exposures and to better understand the impact of such changes on cancer-specific mortality.  

**Methods**

Using primary care records linked to hospitals and the death registry from 1998 to 2021, we conducted descriptive analyses to quantify attendance changes for groups stratified by patient-based exposures (such as Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), ethnicity, age, comorbidity count, practice region, diagnosis time, and cancer subtype) across different phases of the pandemic. The analyses involved examining changes in both attendance volume and consultation rate. We further compared changes in attendance trends to cancer-specific mortality trends. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis with lockdown on 23 Mar 2020 as the intervention point using an ARIMA model. 

**Findings**

From 561,611 eligible individuals, 7,964,685 attendances were recorded. During the first lockdown, the median attendance volume decreased by -35.30% [IQR (-36.10, -34.25)] compared to the preceding pre-pandemic time period, followed by a median change of 4.38% [IQR (2.66, 5.15)] during minimal restrictions. The second and third lockdowns saw more drastic reductions in attendance volume, i.e., -48.71% [IQR (-49.54, -48.26)] and -71.62% [IQR (-72.23, -70.97)] respectively. These reductions were followed by a 4.48% [IQR (3.45, 7.10)] increase in attendance when lockdown restrictions were lifted. The median consultation rate change during the first lockdown was 31.32% [IQR (25.10, 33.60)], followed by a median change of -0.25% [IQR (-1.38, 1.68)] during minimal restrictions. Lockdowns 2 and 3 saw a median consultation rate decrease of -33.89% [IQR (-34.64, -33.18)] and of -4.98% [IQR (-5.71, -4.00)], followed by a 416.16% increase [IQR (409.77, 429.77)] upon lifting of lockdown restrictions. Notably, across many weeks, a year-over-year (YoY) decrease in weekly attendances corresponded with a YoY increase in cancer-specific mortality. Overall, the pandemic period revealed a statistically significant reduction in attendances for patients with cancer (-24070.19 attendances across the period, p <0.0001) compared to pre-pandemic times. We developed a public online tool to share results interactively (https://lailab.shinyapps.io/cancer_hsp/).

**Interpretation**

To our knowledge, this is the first large scale study to offer an unprecedented evaluation of how the UK’s pandemic lockdown affected cancer health service access, spanning all pandemic phases, cancer diagnostic groups and other patient-based exposures. The most adversely affected patient groups during the lockdown face a heightened risk of long-term health repercussions. Those findings provide comprehensive insight to help inform follow-up for such at-risk groups, to guide practice and policy changes to mitigate the impact of future healthcare disruptions, to set a benchmark for assessment of post-pandemic recovery progression and to better understand the effect of existing disparities on healthcare utilisation during crises. The complex interplay of factors that likely contributed to these health service disruptions underscores the importance of effective communication in crisis scenarios.
